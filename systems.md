NQS facilitates the identification of the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship. At the same time, it is sufficiently adaptive to query paraphrasing. We have empirically evaluated the framework with respect to the syntactic robustness of NQS and semantic accuracy of the SPARQL translator on standard benchmark datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dubey et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Inspecific, authors first employ shallow and deep linguistic analysis to transform NL-queriesinto a set of Query Triples with <subject, predict, object> format. Second, they mapeach phrase in Query Triple to the corresponding resource (class, entity, or property)in DBpedia. As a result, Ontology Triples are generated. Thirdly, the SPARQL querieswill be constructed based on Ontology Triple and question type. At last, the generatedSPARQL queries is used to search on the Linked Data, and the best answer can bepicked out through validating and ranking.                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 He et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Then they fill the empty slots in the template with entities, relations from Wikidata and constraints. For entity detection BERT sequence labeling model is used. Relation ranking is performed by BiLSTM, path rankingâby BERT-based ranking model.This KBQA system is capable of answering complex questions with logical or comparative reasoning and was released as a component of open-source DeepPavlov library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Evseev D.

Specifically, an EL system is used to identify entity mentions in the question and link them to the knowledge graph. They combine this with an NMT model that is trained and used to generate template queries with placeholders for entities. Also the model is strengthened with ConvS2S (Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence): a CNN-based architecture, featuring gated linear units, residual connections, and attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Diomedi, Hogan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Since a number of different software components exist that implement different strategies for each of these tasks, it is a major challenge to select and combine the most suitable components into a QA system, given the characteristics of a question. The authors study this optimisation problem and train classifiers, which take features of a question as input and have the goal of optimising the selection of QA components based on those features and devise a greedy algorithm to identify the pipelines that include the suitable components and can effectively answer the given question. We implement this model within Frankenstein, a QA framework able to select QA components and compose QA pipelines. Evaluation results not only suggest that Frankenstein precisely solves the QA optimisation problem but also enables the automatic composition of optimised QA pipelines, which outperform the static Baseline QA pipeline. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Singh et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For each input question, they construct an explicit structural semantic parse (semantic graph). Semantic parses can be deterministically converted to a query to extract the answers from the KB. To investigate ways to encode the structure of a semantic parse and to improve the performance for more complex questions, authors adapt Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNNs), described in Li et al. (2016), to process and score semantic parses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Sorokin and Gurevych                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

First, they propose heterogeneous update rulesthat handle KB nodes differently from the textnodes: for instance, LSTM-based updates are usedto propagate information into and out of text nodes.

Given candidate query graphs generated from one question, their model embeds the question surface and predicate sequences into a uniform vector space. The main difference between their approach and previous methods is that the authors integrate hidden vectors of various semantic components and encode their interaction as the hidden semantics of the entire query graph. In addition, to cope with different semantic components of a query graph, dependency parsing information is leveraged as a complementary of sentential information for question encoding, which makes the model better align each component to the question.                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Luo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Memory Networks are learning systems centered around a memory component that can be read and written to, with a particular focus on cases where the relationship between the input and response languages (here natural language) and the storage language (here, the facts from KBs) is performed by embedding all of them in the same vector space. The setting of the simple QA corresponds to the elementary operation of performing a single lookup in the memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bordes et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It was developed by Marek Ciglan at the Institute of Informatics at the Slovak Academy of Sciences. The method relies on query annotation, where parts of the query are labeled with possible mappings to the given knowledge base. The annotations comprise entities and relations, and were generated by means of a gazetteer, in order to expand relations with synonyms, and a Wikifier tool, in order to annotate entities. From those annotations, MHE constructs possible sub-graphs as query interpretation hypotheses and matches them against the entity graph of DBpedia.

For AddVertex and AddEdge, the model directly predicts instances instead of classes. In this way, the query graph can be completed by only one decoding process without Filling operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

In their approach, the student network aims to find the correct answer to the query, while the teacher network tries to learn intermediate supervision signals for improving the reasoning capacity of the student network. The major novelty lies in the design of the teacher network, where we utilize both forward and backward reasoning to enhance the learning of intermediate entity distributions. By considering bidirectional reasoning, the teacher network can produce more reliable intermediate supervision signals, which can alleviate the issue of spurious reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 He et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

First, we identify entity, relationship, and class names mentioned in a natural language question, and map these to their counterparts in the graph. Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through the graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are aggregated depending on the identified question type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Vakulenko et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In the cited pipeline, the following components were used: NED-tagme (for the entity recognition module), Diambiguation-Property-OKBQA (for the relationmapping module) and Query Builder (for the query generationmodule).                                                                                                                                          |

Given an input question, they first generate its query sketch that is compatible with the underlying structure of the knowledge graph. Then, the query graph is completed by labeling the nodes and edges under the guidance of the structural query pattern. Finally, answers can be retrieved by executing the constructed query graph over the knowledge graph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Zheng et. al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Using identified patterns the authors generate a rule set which is used to generate a natural language sentence containing the answer extracted from a knowledge source, realized into a linguistically correct sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Perera and Nand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The former builds on Quepy, a Python tool for transforming natural language questions into SPARQL or MQL queries. The latter comprises three components, based on Service Oriented Architecture principles: a text annotator that receives the question in plain text and returns a list of compound words annotated with POS tags and lemmas (using Standford Core NLP), the triple builder that builds a list of triples given a list of keywords and URIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Unger et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

To compensate for the omissions, we exploit textual sources associated with entities and relational facts. The system translates user questions into an extended form of structured SPARQL queries, with text predicates attached to triple patterns. robustQA is based on a novel optimization model, cast into an integer linear program, for joint decomposition and disambiguation of the user question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Yahya et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

First step is independent of the knowledge base schema and makes use of very general constraints on the query structure that allows us to maintain semantic ambiguities in different graphs.

The framework consists of three steps: 1. link topic entity from question to knowledge base 2. Identify Core Inferential Chain connected to the topic entity, where relation is matched using a convolutional neural network 3. augment constraint to the chain.  Therefore STAGG is able to extend the query graph to represent more complicated graphs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Yih et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Learning basic graph patterns is efficient due to the small number of possible patterns. This novel paradigm reduces the amount of training data necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance. TeBaQA also speeds up the domain adaption process by transforming the QA system development task into a much smaller and easier data compilation task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Vollmers et al .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The architecture of the virtual player consists of 1) a Question Answering (QA) module, which leverages Wikipedia and DBpedia datasources to retrieve the most relevant passages of text useful to identify the correct answer to a question, 2) an Answer Scoring (AS) module, which assigns a score to each candidate answer according to different criteria based on the passages of text retrieved by the Question Answering module, and 3) a Decision Making (DM) module, which chooses the strategy for playing the game according to specific rules as well as to the scores assigned to the candidate answers.                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Molino et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The detail of the system is emitted since the autho states 'The full details will be disclosed in an upcoming publication as this is only a challenge submission.'. Since the link to this model's demo has the same link as WDAqua-core1, there might be a chance that this system is actually the same as core-1. However, the demo link is not working, making it hard to investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Diefenbach et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

There are two challenges involved: recognizing usersâ query intention and mapping the involved semantic items against a given knowledge base (KB), which will be in turn assembled into a structured query. In this paper, we propose an efficient pipeline framework to model a userâs query intention as a phrase level dependency DAG which is then instantiated according to a given KB to construct the final structured query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Xu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The encoder takes natural question, entities and relation as input, which is initialized  with a 200-dimensional Chinese word embedding trained by [Link](https://aclanthology.org/N18-2028/.) The decoder is a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to generate SPARQL queries by incorporating the representation of entities, relations and SPARQL keywords. Therefore the model is believed to be effective in answering multi-type complex questions, such as factual questions, dual intent ques- tions, boolean questions,  etc.                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Zou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

AE-TQ comprises three stepsâ Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing, semantic information structures (SIS) generation and temporal reasoning, where the first two steps establish the association, and the third step performs the reasoning. Specifically, the AMR parser identify the temporal signal words in the question, as well as the temporal relationships among facts. The question-oriented semantic information structure is derived from AMR graphs for determining semantic roles and question types. Then, temporal reasoning is performed using the structures to obtain the final answers. The experiment on [CronQuestions](wikidata/cron_questions.md) dataset showed that AE-TQ empirically outperforms several competing methods in various settings.| Long et al.|

It also employs constrained decoding to control the output space and minimize generation errors. The model consists of three main components: Multi-grained retriever, target logical form generation, and constrained decoding.<br>The multi-grained retriever performs entity retrieval through a standard pipeline with three steps: mention detection, candidate generation, and entity disambiguation. To better detect zero-shot mentions, the model regards mention detection as a span classification task. <br>The target logical form generation is done using a transformer-based seq2seq model called T5. The input sequence is a concatenation of the input question, retrieved entities, exemplary logical forms, and schema items, with each entity represented by its label and ID. The output sequence is the target logical form. <br> The constrained decoding component, considers operator tokens that conform to the s-expression syntax. Meanwhile, for schema items, their tokens are stored in a trie, which is a prefix tree. Two separate tries store KB classes and relations. When a constraint rule determines that a schema item is currently being decoded, only the options in the trie are deemed valid for the subsequent token.| Shu et al.|
