In the first stage, they predict the query structure of the question and leverage the structure to constrain the generation of the candidate queries and propose a novel graph generation framework to handle the structure prediction task and design an encoder-decoder model to predict the argument of the predetermined operation in each generative step. In the second stage, they follow the previous methods to rank the candidate queries.    | Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

NQS facilitates the identification of the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship.

Inspecific, authors first employ shallow and deep linguistic analysis to transform NL-queriesinto a set of Query Triples with <subject, predict, object> format. Second, they mapeach phrase in Query Triple to the corresponding resource (class, entity, or property)in DBpedia. As a result, Ontology Triples are generated. Thirdly, the SPARQL querieswill be constructed based on Ontology Triple and question type. At last, the generatedSPARQL queries is used to search on the Linked Data, and the best answer can bepicked out through validating and ranking.  | He et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Since a number of different software components exist that implement different strategies for each of these tasks, it is a major challenge to select and combine the most suitable components into a QA system, given the characteristics of a question. The authors study this optimisation problem and train classifiers, which take features of a question as input and have the goal of optimising the selection of QA components based on those features and devise a greedy algorithm to identify the pipelines that include the suitable components and can effectively answer the given question. We implement this model within Frankenstein, a QA framework able to select QA components and compose QA pipelines. Evaluation results not only suggest that Frankenstein precisely solves the QA optimisation problem but also enables the automatic composition of optimised QA pipelines, which outperform the static Baseline QA pipeline. | Singh et al. |

Given candidate query graphs generated from one question, their model embeds the question surface and predicate sequences into a uniform vector space. The main difference between their approach and previous methods is that the authors integrate hidden vectors of various semantic components and encode their interaction as the hidden semantics of the entire query graph. In addition, to cope with different semantic components of a query graph, dependency parsing information is leveraged as a complementary of sentential information for question encoding, which makes the model better align each component to the question.   | Luo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It was developed by Marek Ciglan at the Institute of Informatics at the Slovak Academy of Sciences. The method relies on query annotation, where parts of the query are labeled with possible mappings to the given knowledge base. The annotations comprise entities and relations, and were generated by means of a gazetteer, in order to expand relations with synonyms, and a Wikifier tool, in order to annotate entities. From those annotations, MHE constructs possible sub-graphs as query interpretation hypotheses and matches them against the entity graph of DBpedia. MHE was the onlyQALD-2 participant that provided answers to alltypes of questions, performing best on string anddate questions.    | Only in organizers' report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

In their approach, the student network aims to find the correct answer to the query, while the teacher network tries to learn intermediate supervision signals for improving the reasoning capacity of the student network. The major novelty lies in the design of the teacher network, where we utilize both forward and backward reasoning to enhance the learning of intermediate entity distributions. By considering bidirectional reasoning, the teacher network can produce more reliable intermediate supervision signals, which can alleviate the issue of spurious reasoning    | He et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

First, we identify entity, relationship, and class names mentioned in a natural language question, and map these to their counterparts in the graph. Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through the graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are aggregated depending on the identified question type.    |   Vakulenko et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Given an input question, they first generate its query sketch that is compatible with the underlying structure of the knowledge graph. Then, the query graph is completed by labeling the nodes and edges under the guidance of the structural query pattern. Finally, answers can be retrieved by executing the constructed query graph over the knowledge graph. | Zheng et. al.   |

To compensate for the omissions, we exploit textual sources associated with entities and relational facts.

Learning basic graph patterns is efficient due to the small number of possible patterns. This novel paradigm reduces the amount of training data necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance. TeBaQA also speeds up the domain adaption process by transforming the QA system development task into a much smaller and easier data compilation task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Vollmers et al .|

The architecture of the virtual player consists of 1) a Question Answering (QA) module, which leverages Wikipedia and DBpedia datasources to retrieve the most relevant passages of text useful to identify the correct answer to a question, 2) an Answer Scoring (AS) module, which assigns a score to each candidate answer according to different criteria based on the passages of text retrieved by the Question Answering module, and 3) a Decision Making (DM) module, which chooses the strategy for playing the game according to specific rules as well as to the scores assigned to the candidate answers.     | Molino et al.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The detail of the system is emitted since the autho states 'The full details will be disclosed in an upcoming publication as this is only a challenge submission.'. Since the link to this model's demo has the same link as WDAqua-core1, there might be a chance that this system is actually the same as core-1.

The approach firstly takes the predicate sequence of the question in knowledge graphs as the breakthrough and constructs the core path, with the constraint learnt on the question. The final answer to the question is determined through the query path. The model is tested on webquestionSP and MetaQA dataset and achieve competitive performance on some multi-hop subsets. |  Yang et al.|
